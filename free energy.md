## ABSTRACT

Antibodies that recognize the spike protein of SARS-COV-2, especially the neutralizing antibodies, carry great hope in the treatment and final elimination of COVID-19. Driven by a synchronized global effort, thousands of antibodies against the spike protein have been identified during the past two years. Among them, the corresponding structural information for hundreds of these antibodies became available and thus provided an excellent opportunity for the theoretical investigation to catch up. We chose MM/PBSA, an efficient approach for estimating the binding free energy between the antibodies and the RBD domain of SARS-COV-2 spike proteins. We discovered that adding explicitly-treated water molecules to the interface between RBD and antibody effectively improves the results. These interfacial water molecules, together with surface and internal water molecules, behave drastically from bulk water and exert peculiar impacts on protein dynamics and energy. Our results demonstrate the importance of these structural water molecules and provide an effective treatment for more accurate binding free energy calculations. 



# INTRODUCTION

​	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has become a pandemic for more than two years. The SARS-CoV-2 virus belongs to the family of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, which includes seasonal coronavirus, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 attacks cells in the respiratory system, mainly through a specific interaction between the spike glycoprotein on the viral surface and the corresponding receptor on cell surface, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, much of the ongoing global research effort on SARS-CoV-2 has been devoted to the understanding of spike in membrane fusion and viral entry and the development of strategies to block the interaction between spike with ACE2.
